            <p>Neil Armstrong, a super-brave pilot, dreamed of flying high! He learned to fly planes,
                 even super-fast ones, and became an astronaut. In 1969, he went on a rocket to the Moon!
                  He became the first person to walk on it, saying famous words about a "small step" for him,
                   but a "giant leap" for everyone. Even though he was a hero, he was very humble. 
                   He taught others and inspired kids to dream big. When we look at the Moon, we remember
                    his courage and how he showed us that amazing things are possible!

                <ul>
                    <li>The Apollo 11 Mission:</li><br>
                    <li>He stepped out of the spacecraft and onto the Moon's surface.</li><br>
                    <li>He said those famous words, "That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.</li><br>
                    <li>This meant that even though it was just one step for him, it was a huge achievement for all of humanity.</li><br>
                    <li>Awarded Bharat Ratna, Padma Vibhushan, and Padma Bhushan</li><br>
                    <li>Inspired millions through education, books, and lectures</li>  <br>    
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Neil Armstrong's footprints on the Moon remind us that even the biggest dreams can come true."
